Joseph Brodsky’s translations of his own Russian-language poems into English “new originals” have been criticized for their “un-Englishness,”
an appraisal based on a narrow understanding of translation itself. With this radical reassessment of the Nobel Prize winner’s self-translations,
Zakhar Ishov proposes a fresh approach to poetry translation and challenges the assumption that poetic form is untranslatable. 

Brodsky in English draws on previously unexamined archival materials,
including drafts and correspondence with translators and publishers,
to trace the arc of Brodsky’s experience with the English language.
Ishov shows how Brodsky’s belief in the intellectual continuity between his former life in the
Soviet Union and his new career in the United States, including as Poet Laureate, anchored his
insistence on maintaining the formal architecture of his poems in translation, locating the transmission of
poetic meaning in the rhythms of language itself. This book highlights Brodsky’s place within the long
history of the compromises translation must make between linguistic material and poetic process.
