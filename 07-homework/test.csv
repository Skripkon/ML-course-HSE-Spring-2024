We had issues with tickets as they cancelled one of the tickets and trying to get it sorted cost a lot of money due to roaming charges for the lengthy phone calls which were needed to get the ticket reinstated and them trying to charge varying amounts to resolve it. This was a very poor service. 

We got to the airport and had to check in at the desk due to this issue which meant online check in couldn't be done. We were in premium economy which was spacious, two seats on either side of the plane and 3 seats in the middle. The plane seemed relatively new but not brand new. Legroom was good, seats were wider and had bigger arm rest in between the two seats which had the fold away tray tables in. There was a good choice of movies and other things such as TV shows, games etc. The food was ok, didn't seem to be much different from economy standard. The flight crew seemed friendly enough. They didn't really go up and down the isles with drinks only maybe twice for the whole 13-14 hour flight, which on other airlines they would have done it quite often.

Overall the flight was ok, seats were comfy, legroom good. Food was ok. The flight crew could have been more attentive especially with it being premium economy, you would expect the service to be slightly better than economy.",Ok,0

The cabin crew was warm and friendly and, most importantly, came across as sincere and genuine. Throughout the flight, I interacted with Leading Stewardess Sharifah the most, who went all the way out to ensure we were comfortable and well taken care of. I saw her patrolling the cabin consistently to check if we needed anything(I could see her looking into the Suite), and she was always read y to assist us. She even offered to make up our bed after the breakfast run so that we could rest. When I asked if I could walk around both decks of the aircraft, Sharifah volunteered to show me around. She was very knowledgeable about the configurations in the A380 aircraft and even pointed to the best seats in each cabin class as we walked through. 

The Suites Class cabin resembles the private cabins onboard sleeper trains, which gives Suites Class passengers some form of privacy. The cut holes on the cabin doors, in the shape of a flower design, somewhat reduce the privacy we got in the Suites Class cabins. There are two lavatories at the front of the aircraft catering to the six Suites Class passengers. The lavatory on the right is the bigger of the two, featuring a vanity table between the toilet and the sink.  There is plenty of space in this lavatory for passengers to change into the Lalique pyjamas provided to Suites Class passengers. The lavatory on the left was smaller but no less luxurious. Passengers using this lavatory can still find it spacious to change in and out of their pyjamas. This lavatory still provides the same amenities as the larger lavatory. 

Not all suites have the same size. The biggest are the foremost Suites (1A and 1F), about 5m2; the smallest (3A and 3F) are the aftmost Suites measuring 3.3m2. I occupy the middle Suite (2A) with 4m2 of real estate. Each Suite is fitted with both a chair and a bed.  The walls of the Suite were printed with floral designs that enhanced the luxurious vibe and did not come across as being too loud or over the top, consistent with the design language of the cabin. A side table sits by the entrance of the Suite. The flight attendants use this side table to place our drinks or snacks without needing to deploy the table.  The table is solid and huge, providing tons of space for Suites Class passengers.  The table can be swivelled for passengers to get in and out of the seat without stowing it away. 

The seat was the first thing that caught my eye when I entered my Suite and is very comfortable. An oversized pillow is placed onto the seat to provide passengers with greater comfort, especially in reclined mode. The seat measures 35"" wide and can recline up to 45°. The calf rest of the seat can only be deployed when the seat is swivelled to face the TV or the front of the aircraft (the green light on the control panel would light up to indicate calf rests can be deployed). Swivelling of the seat is controlled electronically via the control panel built into the left side of its armrest or the tablet provided in the Suite. There are two power sockets that came fitted with USB-A charging outlets in the Suite, one at the side of the side table at the entrance of the Suite and another on the storage cubby by the window. Singapore Airlines Suites Class features a bed in the Suite on top of the comfortable seat. Singapore Airlines uses Lalique bedding for the bed. I found the bed was very sturdy, lacking in terms of comfort. The mattress padding was a tad thin and lacked cushioning. The two pillows that came with the bed were too soft for my liking. 

There is no lack of storage space in the Suites Class onboard Singapore Airlines. Besides the pockets and shelving on the bulkheads and the seat, there is a small wardrobe by the door. Due to the slim design of the wardrobe, a limited amount of things can be stowed here. There is space in the wardrobe for passengers to hang their jackets. The bottom part of the wardrobe allowed me to stow away my backpack. More storage is fitted into the bulkhead of the Suite. Due to the shallow design of these cubbies, I could only use them to store smaller items. Singapore Airlines designed an open shelving space with a single leather strap beneath the cubby holes. Singapore Airlines fitted a 32"" HD touchscreen TV in the Suite. The TV can be swivelled with a touch of a button either on the seat or from the tablet to face the passengers when sitting on the seat. There are two IFE controllers in the Suite; a smaller one is stowed in the seat's armrest, which I found very intuitive to use. The other IFE controller is via tablet in the Suite.",The service in Suites Class makes one feel like VIP,0

2024-03-11T19:39:13-04:00,Desktop,1,review,"Respected Faculty, I am Bincy, writing this  to file a complaint regarding a cancellation of the connection flight of Singapore airlines and the irresponsible service from Singapore airlines airport staff members at Singapore .My parents 67 yr old Dad as 63 yr old Mom travelled from Brisbane airport in Singapore airlines  SQ236 yesterday at 14.45 hrs and arrived at Singapore airport at 20.25hrs yesterday late evening. Then only they were informed that the connection flight SQ 536 which was booked and  confirmed, has got cancelled and they have to wait until next day night. This was not informed to us in any form of communication.  And secondly, though my parents are very older with so many health issues, (my parents are Diabetic also, taking insulin and my parents have high blood pressure, taking medications)but they had to wait in airport in a chair without any support for 24 hours without any food especially when they are from a non English speaking background. The mental stress and physical discomforts for 24 hours they were gone through are unimaginable and we cannot express it to the full extent. They didn't get any emotional or physical support from staffs at Singapore airport.They didn't arrange any room to rest or any proper lounge and not even any food for 24 hours (my parents were not prepared to stay at airport for more than 4 hours as  we booked the tickets with least transit time at Singapore airport) We had a trust in the services of Singapore airlines, and so we booked the flight for our parents with much confidence.  We booked the tickets through an agency Sanjo travels in India but we got the confirmation that Singapore airlines didn't inform the agency as well. So it's completely the mistake from Singapore Airlines.","Very bad, disappointed",0
2024-03-11T19:39:13-04:00,Desktop,1,review,"I would rate Singapore airlines the worse I have ever travelled with. The only plus was we left on time & arrived on time. Firstly no one  brought headsets had to ask for one. The bfst omelette was awful part yellow part brown, the rest inedible.  The milk & butter if you get any! Now comes in liquid form squeeze tubes. No decaffeinated coffee no hot chocolate. We then had a wait of nearly 11 hrs without food, I went to the galley hoping to get a sandwich but all that was available was banana or kitkat!!! Other than trays water nothing was brought around in the 11 hrs!! No choice of juice. The films available where limited & not up to date. Dinner eventually arrived again inedible no before dinner drinks , the trolley had a choice red wine or white wine ( Chardonnay) but you only got half a plastic cup of wine no repeats!! I believe this cost cutting is to their detriment. Out of choice would never travel with them again.",Give Singapore airlines a miss.,1
2024-03-11T19:39:13-04:00,Desktop,1,review,"Singapore Airlines (SQ), may be one of the largest airlines in the world but its customer service is appaling. Our flight was canceled and instead of 4 hours of stopover in Singapore, we now have 16 hours to wait! And nothing ! No excuse, no compensation! What company treats its customers like this ? I called customer service several times and the third time I found a person who was very rude, like ""4 p.m., you have time to visit the city, what are you complaining about?"" . We will arrive before midnight, we leave after 3 p.m. We will have to take a hotel and the company won't even compensate us. one of the best airlines in the world? Really ?",Very disappointed !,1
2024-03-11T19:39:13-04:00,Desktop,1,review,"Yesterday ( 6 March ) my flight was canceled by the Singapore airlines . After many calls they said that you bought the ticket through booking.com and call them and they should resolve this issue. and singapore airlines didn't want to talk to me anymore.  I called booking.com and they tell me to call to Singapore airlines.I explain to them that Singapore airlines does not want to help me because I took the tickets through you.  This went on for several hours. a few hours later Singapore airlines gave me another flight in another state( I bought ticket from JFK NY State , they give EWR NJ ; ) it will cost by taxi around 300$ from NY to Newark  no matter how bad it was, I agreed and thought that I would fly the next day. but... when I started registering I noticed a mistake they made.  They gave me a two flights :  first from EWR - SQ 21•7 March 9:35 AM- 8 MARCH 5:25 PM Singapore airport .  But my second flight was SQ 728  8 MARCH   9:50 AM from Singapore .  How it is possible ? if the plane arrives in Singapore on March 8 IN THE EVENING 5:25 pm and second flight has departure is IN THE MORNING on that day?!!!!  I called again to booking .com they send me again to Singapore airlines , Singapore airlines send me again to booking ( Singapore airlines did not want to do anything for me.  if they wanted they would solve this problem!!!!  I had a similar situation with Emirates airlines , my ticket also was booked from booking .com .  Emirates  resolved same problem  quickly without any difficulties and with many apologies.  But  Singapore airlines didn’t even apologize and most importantly, it didn’t want to help solve the problem that iT SELF CREATED .   After many calls to booking.com representative told: WE DO NOT have any flight for your second connection. When I asked : What I need to do , I need to fly , I bought ticket . He said me ….. call to Singapore airlines .  I explained again and again Singapore airlines send me to your company. But representative said me : we can not do you second flight. Call to Singapore airlines. My vacation was ruined and I was very upset . I will never buy tickets through Booking.com again and never through Singapore airlines also.  Inhumane people work here who do not want to solve the problem that they themselves created.  This is a real mockery of a person . A SHAME!!! . I will write everywhere and tell everyone about such unfair treatment of people. I buy another ticket from another company , I spend my nervous, money , my time !!!  A SHAME!!! Never again with booking.com and Singapore airlines . NEVER",THE WORST EXPERIENCE IN MY LIFE,3
